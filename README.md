## What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?

> **Answer Engine Optimization** is the practice of optimizing your brand's digital presence so AI chatbots and answer engines — like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, and Claude — recommend your brand accurately, positively, and frequently when users ask questions about your industry.

Traditional SEO optimized for Google search results. AEO optimizes for the AI-generated answers that 500M+ users now consume daily. AEOAI.digital is the first production-ready, open-source platform purpose-built for this new paradigm.

## Key Takeaways

| Area | What AEOAI.digital Does |
|------|-----------------|
| **AI Brand Monitoring** | Automatically tracks how ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude mention your brand |
| **Share of Voice (SOV)** | Measures your brand visibility vs competitors across all AI engines |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | LLM-as-Judge evaluates every mention as positive, neutral, or negative |
| **Citation Tracking** | Extracts sources and citations from AI responses to find link opportunities |
| **Competitor Intelligence** | Identifies which competitors appear and why they're being recommended |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Auto-extracts entities, claims, and relationships from AI responses |

---

## Why AEOAI.digital?

### The Problem
Every day, millions of users ask AI engines questions like "What's the best [your product]?" or "Top [your industry] tools." If your brand isn't mentioned — or worse, is mentioned negatively — you're losing trust, traffic, and revenue. Traditional SEO tools can't help because they're built for crawlers, not for conversational AI.

### The Solution
AEOAI.digital bridges this gap with a complete AEO workflow:

1. **Capture** — Uses real browser automation (Camoufox + Playwright) to navigate AI engine web UIs, submit your keywords, and capture the exact Markdown response as a real user would see it
2. **Evaluate** — An LLM-as-Judge (via OpenRouter) analyzes each response for brand visibility, sentiment, competitor mentions, hallucination detection, and entity extraction
3. **Visualize** — Real-time dashboard shows your Share of Voice, keyword performance, sentiment trends, and competitive landscape across all engines
4. **Optimize** — AI-powered recommendations help you improve your brand's presence in AI-generated answers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v20+
- **pnpm** v9+
- **Redis** instance
- **Python 3.10+** (optional, for Camoufox browser automation)
- **OpenRouter API key** (optional, for LLM-as-Judge evaluation)

### Scan Execution Mode

AEOAI.digital supports two scan execution modes controlled by `MENTHA_SCAN_EXECUTION_MODE`:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `browser` (default) | Uses Camoufox browser automation to navigate AI engine web UIs | Local development, accurate UI responses |
| `api` | Uses OpenRouter API calls instead of browser automation | SaaS deployment, server environments without browsers |
| `hybrid` | Runs both browser and API scans in parallel | Maximum coverage during development |

Set in `apps/api/.env`:
```bash
MENTHA_SCAN_EXECUTION_MODE=browser   # browser | api | hybrid
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...         # Required for 'api' or 'hybrid' mode
```

### Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenruuu/mentha.git
cd mentha
pnpm install
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start the onboarding flow.

- `get_brand_visibility` — Check brand presence across AI engines
- `analyze_sentiment` — Get sentiment analysis for specific keywords
- `track_competitors` — Monitor competitor mentions
- `get_optimization_tips` — Receive AI-powered improvement suggestions

## FAQ

### What is Answer Engine Optimization?
AEO is the practice of optimizing brand presence across AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude. Unlike SEO (which targets Google's search results), AEO targets the conversational answers that AI generates for user queries.

### How is Mentha different from SEO tools?
Traditional SEO tools crawl websites and track keyword rankings in Google. Mentha uses real browser automation to submit queries to AI engines, captures the exact responses, and evaluates them with an LLM-as-Judge. This is fundamentally different — you see exactly what your users see when they ask AI about your brand.

### Does Mentha require API keys for AI engines?
No. Mentha uses browser automation (Camoufox + Playwright) to interact with AI engines through their web UIs, just like a real user would. You only need to log in to each engine once through the Provider Connections panel.

### Which AI engines are supported?
Perplexity, ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), and Google AI Overviews.

### Is Mentha free and open source?
Yes. Mentha is MIT-licensed open source. You can self-host it completely free. Optional features (LLM-as-Judge evaluation) require an OpenRouter API key.

### What is Share of Voice in AI search?
Share of Voice (SOV) measures how often your brand is mentioned across AI engine responses compared to competitors. A higher SOV means AI engines recommend your brand more frequently than alternatives.

### How does the LLM-as-Judge work?
GPT-4o-mini evaluates each AI response using a structured system prompt. It extracts sentiment score, brand visibility, recommendation type, competitor mentions, keyword intent, and detected entities. A heuristic fallback exists if no API key is configured.

### Can I schedule regular scans?
Yes. Mentha supports automated daily and weekly recurring scans via scheduled BullMQ jobs with cron-based triggers.

## Project Status

Mentha is under active development. The browser automation system (Camoufox) relies on AI engine web UIs which may change or require login sessions. For production reliability, use `api` scan mode with an OpenRouter API key.

**Version:** 1.0.0 (see [releases](https://github.com/beenruuu/mentha/releases))
